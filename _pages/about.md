I am a research scientist at [Deep Genomics](https://deepgenomics.com/) working on computational biology and statistical genetics. Broadly, I'm interested in how we can use machine learning to understand how transcription and translation are regulated. I also have interests in population genetics. 

Previously I completed my DPhil thesis in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Gerton Lunter and Thomas Milne. There I used and developed machine learning methods to understand transcriptional regulation in MLL recombinant leukemia and helped develop a particle filter for demographic inference. Check out my [recent publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5W10qpIAAAAJ&hl=en) for more information on those and my previous projects. I love to code, both for work and for hobbies, and a semi-complete list of previous publicly available projects is also found on this page.   

Outside of work, I love to hike with my dog and be in nature, ideally while holding a nice cup of coffee. I love to cook and bake, and try to run as much as I can. I'm also learning Mandarin Chinese. 

我慢慢学中文在牛津语言中心。 我的女朋友是中国人，我们去了北京。
